My Name is Zeeshan Ahmad and I am presenting you the brief summary of this project. I was assigned this task on Accenture Virtual Intership stimulation
stimulation program by "forage" . 

The project is related to a company named "Social Buzz".In this project I had tried to solve the Business problem and 
meet the specific requirements of the Client.I had Cleaned, modelled and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into 
content trends to inform strategic decisions.
I had also Prepared presentation report to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders.

I had used these 5 steps:
1. Data understanding - the key to success on any data project is to understand 
the data in detail. So I took the time to understand the data model and 
domain of your business.
2. Data cleaning - after understanding your business, I then cleaned the 
available datasets and thought about what an ideal dataset should look like for 
this problem.
3. Data modelling - After ensuring the data was clean for analysis, I needed 
to process and model this data into a dataset that can precisely answer the 
business questions and produce the results needed.
4. Data analysis - With our new dataset, I used analytical skills to 
uncover insights from this dataset and to produce visualizations to describe the 
insights.
5. And finally I used these insights to unlock business decisions and to make 
recommendations on next steps.
